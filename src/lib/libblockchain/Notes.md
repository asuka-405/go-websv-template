Blockchain is nothing but a digital leger that stores transactions in real time.

Each transaction is a block.

A block is digitally signed -> message + BlockUUiD = content to be signed
this is so that no one can copy the message to the next block in the chain since every block will need to be signed seperately because of the block uuid

Must know entire history of transactions to prevent overspending.

The system is decentralised:

- everyone maintains private legers
- transaction broadcast with proof of work
